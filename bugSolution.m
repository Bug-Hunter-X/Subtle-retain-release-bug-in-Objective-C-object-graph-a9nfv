The solution is to use `self.myString = myString;` instead of manually retaining and releasing the string.  Modern Objective-C's ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) handles this automatically, but for legacy code or understanding the concepts, here's the corrected code:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    // [myString release];  // Removed - ARC handles this or use property synthesized with retain
    [super dealloc];
}

- (void)setString:(NSString *)myString {
    [self.myString release]; //For Manual Reference Counting. Not needed in ARC.
    self.myString = [myString retain]; //For Manual Reference Counting. Not needed in ARC.
}
@end

// ... in some method ...
MyClass *obj = [[MyClass alloc] init];
obj.myString = [NSString stringWithString:@
