# Objective-C Retain/Release Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Objective-C related to memory management with `retain` and `release` when objects are part of a larger object graph. The bug involves potential double-release issues or memory leaks depending on how the object graph is handled.

The `bug.m` file contains code illustrating the problematic scenario.  The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version with explanations of the changes to avoid the memory management issues.

## Bug Description

The bug stems from improper handling of object ownership when nesting objects and using the `retain`/`release` mechanisms of Objective-C's manual memory management.  Incorrect `retain` counts can lead to double releases (crash) or memory leaks.  Modern Objective-C with ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) generally prevents these bugs, but understanding this issue is crucial when working with legacy code.

## Solution

The solution typically involves careful consideration of object ownership and ensuring each object is released only once.  ARC significantly simplifies this, but in legacy code, proper use of `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` is vital.  Using tools like Instruments (in Xcode) helps detect memory-related problems during development.
